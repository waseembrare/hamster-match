# hamster-match

The Jan '21 cohort of iO-academy was challenged to make a pairs match memory game as a group using scrum methodology. The final two stories were not completed in task week, so this repo was created as an extra-curricular continuation of the project. Members of the class helped to finish off the project to the complete spec from the challenge week.
